## Planning the Feature
- [ ] Define the feature requirements
- [ ] Create user stories or use cases
- [ ] Identify necessary database changes
- [ ] Plan the API endpoints (if needed)
- [ ] Design the UI/UX (if applicable)

## Setting Up the Development Environment
1. Ensure you have the latest version of the code
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Install/update dependencies
   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your feature
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Database Changes
1. Create a new migration
   ```bash
   php artisan make:migration create_table_name_table
   ```
2. Define the schema in the migration file
3. Run the migration
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
4. Create a seeder (if needed)
   ```bash
   php artisan make:seeder YourTableNameSeeder
   ```

## Creating Models
1. Generate a new model
   ```bash
   php artisan make:model ModelName
   ```
2. Define fillable fields, relationships, and other model logic
3. Create model factories for testing
   ```bash
   php artisan make:factory ModelNameFactory --model=ModelName
   ```

## Creating Controllers
1. Generate a new controller
   ```bash
   php artisan make:controller YourControllerName
   ```
2. Implement the necessary methods (CRUD operations)
3. Add validation logic
4. Implement business logic

## Creating Views
1. Create new Blade templates in the appropriate directory
2. Use components and layouts for consistency
3. Implement responsive design
4. Add client-side validation if needed

## Routes
1. Define web routes in `routes/web.php`
2. For API routes, use `routes/api.php`
3. Group related routes and use middleware when necessary

## Testing
1. Create feature tests
   ```bash
   php artisan make:test YourFeatureTest
   ```
2. Create unit tests for complex logic
3. Test all possible scenarios (success, failure, edge cases)
4. Run the test suite
   ```bash
   php artisan test
   ```

## Documentation
1. Update this documentation if the process changes
2. Document API endpoints (if applicable)
3. Add inline code documentation
4. Update README.md if necessary

## Deployment
1. Commit your changes
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your feature description"
   ```
2. Push to the remote repository
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Create a pull request
4. Address code review feedback
5. Merge to main after approval
6. Deploy to production following the deployment process

## Best Practices
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Keep commits atomic and well-documented
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Consider security implications
- Optimize for performance
